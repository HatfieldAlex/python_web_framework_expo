## ⚡ Initialising a Project

The very first thing I this comparison between the frameworks was how different the “getting started” moment feels.

| Framework | Built-in project scaffolding? | Typical first step |
|-----------|------------------------------|--------------------|
| **Django** | ✅ Yes | `django-admin startproject myproject` |
| **Flask** | ❌ No | Create your own folder and `app.py` file |
| **FastAPI** | ❌ No | Create your own folder and `main.py` file |

Django could be spun up with just a single comman - `django-admin startproject` instantly led to settings, URLs, WSGI/ASGI entry points, all ready to go. By contrast, Flask and FastAPI needed to be setup manually.
